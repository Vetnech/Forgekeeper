Hello!

I made Forgekeeper for my game development discord server Royal Foundry. https://discord.gg/PTgxuQkA3r   <br/>
I don't know how to make a discord bot but I understand code when I read it.   <br/>
I made this bot to create category roles for my level roles as the arcane bot wants 7$ for that :/   <br/>

listener.js is required to keep the bot online as the host demands it.   <br/>
index.js is the start/run file.

Contributions are welcome.
